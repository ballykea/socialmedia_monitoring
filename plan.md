## Event to be Monitored ##
* COVID-19 pandemic disease  
* COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public.

**Applicable Incident Action Plan/Crisis and Risk Communication Plan<!--Emergency Operations Center/Multi-Agency Coordination Center/Joint Information Center-->  Goals:** 
* Monitor the public concern by managing information and providing timely messaging to the public and media. 
* Plan for the next phase of the response including widespread mitigation strategies.
* In addition to the information released through the media, the Forsyth County public webpage and FCDPH social media channels will be used as secondary sources to disseminate information and recommendations to the public. The FCDPH website and social media pages will need to be updated regularly and information should be distributed on a timely basis to community partners who can also post information on their webpages and social media channels.

**Notes:**   
 - Your most important audience is people who are simultaneously extremely anxious and not yet doing much.
 - By all means keep telling us what to do. Tell us as often and as emphatically as you can. You’re likely to think you’re shouting when you sound to us like you’re whispering; you’re likely to think you’ve already said it ad nauseam when we haven’t yet taken it in.
 - Also tell us what you will probably want us to do next, when the local situation gets a little worse. And then think very hard about whether you should tell us to do those things now. Whatever precaution is next in your phased approach to pandemic management, consider that you’re probably behind the curve (partly because of the battle between your gut feelings and your brain!). By the time it is clear that you should recommend avoiding crowded subways or clear that you should mandate cancelation of large gatherings, it will be clear that you should have done those things earlier. So consider implementing now what you suspect (and your gut knows) you will have to implement next week, when the virus will have more than doubled from where it is today.
 - But recommending and mandating are only the technical parts of your job. A good leader also needs to acknowledge, validate, and share both halves of our pandemic ambivalence – both our gut anxiety and our cognitive resistance. Understand why so many of us will initially think you are overreacting (even if we will later think you underreacted). Help us be more at peace with our fears, but also our other reactions: the surreal mix of self-doubt, embarrassment, alienation, and misery.
 - But be careful how you say it. “I know you’re afraid” is intrusive. Such a direct approach can trigger defensive self-doubting denial instead of determination and action. “Some people have told me they’re afraid” is better. Best: “Just about everyone in this office is feeling that knot in our stomachs, so we know a lot of other people must be feeling it too. And rightly so! This is a frightening time. Our job now, everyone’s job, is to bear what we’re feeling and take action to help protect ourselves and our communities.”
 - Avoid false optimism. Avoid ridiculing other people’s fears. The prospects look pretty grim but actual panic is rare. Aim for the language of determination and resilience and communitarianism.
