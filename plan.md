## Event to be Monitored ##
* 4th Planetary Defense Interagency Tabletop Exercise. The NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), in partnership with the FEMA Response Directorate, will hold a 1.5-day tabletop exercise (TTX) with senior officials to exercise governmental response to a hypothetical asteroid impact threat and assess national preparedness. The TTX will be Wednesday, February 23 & Thursday, February 24, 2022. Players can participate in-person in Laurel, MD or remotely.

**TTX objectives:** Exercise the National Near-Earth Objects (NEO) Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan to
    + Increase the understanding of personnel and US-government institutions of NEO threats and their roles in mitigating that threat.
    + Gain high-level participation from all institutions, including USSF and USSPACECOM.
    + Test methods of communication information both to and among decision makers.
    + Exercise post-impact protocols, including involvement of local government.
