## Event to be Monitored ##
* 4th Planetary Defense Interagency Tabletop Exercise. The NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), in partnership with the FEMA Response Directorate, will hold a 1.5-day tabletop exercise (TTX) with senior officials to exercise governmental response to a hypothetical asteroid impact threat and assess national preparedness. The TTX will be Wednesday, February 23 & Thursday, February 24, 2022. Players can participate in-person in Laurel, MD or remotely.
* THREAT SCENARIO: Astronomers discover an asteroid, designated 2022 TTX, that might impact the Earth in 6 months. As the exercise unfolds, it becomes clear that the asteroid will indeed impact Earth and is large enough to cause substantial regional damage. The asteroid size, and therefore its impact energy and the detailed
damage it would cause, remains highly uncertain until just days before impact. 

**DETAILS and EXISTING PLANS:**
* TTX4 Read Ahead Materials [TTX4_readAhead_v14_small.pdf](https://github.com/ballykea/socialmedia_monitoring/files/8081343/TTX4_readAhead_v14_small.pdf)
* Additional scenario details cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/pd/cs/ttx22
* National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan (2018) www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/ostp-neo-strategy-action-plan-jun18.pdf
* Report on Near-Earth Object Impact Threat Emergency Protocols (2021) www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/neo-impact-threat-emergency-protocols-jan2021.pdf

**TTX objectives:** Exercise the National Near-Earth Objects (NEO) Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan to
* Increase the understanding of personnel and US-government institutions of NEO threats and their roles in mitigating that threat.
* Gain high-level participation from all institutions, including USSF and USSPACECOM.
* Test methods of communication information both to and among decision makers.
* Exercise post-impact protocols, including involvement of local government.

**Applicable Multi-Agency Coordination Center Goal:** Coordinate real-time messaging through multi-agency PIO’s, governmental media and social media sources.  
**Note:** In this incident, it will be particularly important to monitor citizen responses to official information.
